- ## Description

  Implementation of Converting Live Speech to Text in iOS App. To clarify why I didn't use Google API, in order to access this API I hadd to enable free trial of my Google Cloud Accoount and this was taking longer than I expected because of my country regulations and banking system.

  Iâ€™ve included my README in the Playground.
